# AgentCore Project

This project contains configuration and infrastructure for an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore application.

The `agentcore/` directory serves as a declarative model of an AgentCore project along with a concrete implementation
through the `agentcore/cdk/` project which is modeled to take the configs as input. The project uses a **flat resource
model** where agents, memories, and credentials are top-level arrays.

## Mental Model

The project uses a **flat resource model**. Agents, memories, and credentials are independent top-level arrays in
`agentcore.json`. There is no binding or attachment between resources in the schema — each resource is provisioned
independently. To use a memory or credential from an agent, the application code discovers the resource at runtime
(e.g., via environment variables or SDK calls). Tags defined in `agentcore.json` flow through to deployed CloudFormation resources.

## Critical Invariants

1. **Schema-First Authority:** The `.json` files are the absolute source of truth. Do not attempt to modify agent
   behavior by editing the generated CDK code in `cdk/`.
2. **Resource Identity:** The `name` field in the schema determines the CloudFormation Logical ID.
   - **Renaming** an agent or target will **destroy and recreate** that resource.
   - **Modifying** other fields (descriptions, config) will update the resource **in-place**.
3. **1:1 Validation:** The schema maps directly to valid CloudFormation. If your JSON conforms to the types in
   `.llm-context/`, it will deploy successfully.
4. **Resource Removal:** To remove all resources, use `agentcore remove all`. To tear down deployed infrastructure, run
   `agentcore deploy` after removal — it will detect the empty state and offer a teardown flow.

## Schema Reference

The `agentcore/.llm-context/` directory contains TypeScript type definitions optimized for AI coding assistants. Each
file maps to a JSON config file and includes validation constraints as comments.

| JSON Config                  | Schema File                             | Root Type               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `agentcore/agentcore.json`   | `agentcore/.llm-context/agentcore.ts`   | `AgentCoreProjectSpec`  |
| `agentcore/aws-targets.json` | `agentcore/.llm-context/aws-targets.ts` | `AWSDeploymentTarget[]` |

### Key Types

- **AgentCoreProjectSpec**: Root project configuration with `agents`, `memories`, `credentials` arrays
- **AgentEnvSpec**: Agent configuration (runtime, entrypoint, code location)
- **Memory**: Memory resource with strategies and expiry
- **Credential**: API key credential provider

### Common Enum Values

- **BuildType**: `'CodeZip'` | `'Container'`
- **NetworkMode**: `'PUBLIC'`
- **RuntimeVersion**: `'PYTHON_3_10'` | `'PYTHON_3_11'` | `'PYTHON_3_12'` | `'PYTHON_3_13'` | `'PYTHON_3_14'`
- **MemoryStrategyType**: `'SEMANTIC'` | `'SUMMARIZATION'` | `'USER_PREFERENCE'` | `'EPISODIC'`

### Build Types

- **CodeZip**: Python source is packaged as a zip artifact and deployed directly to AgentCore Runtime.
- **Container**: Agent code is built as a Docker container image. Requires a `Dockerfile` in the agent's `codeLocation`
  directory. At deploy time, the source is uploaded to S3, built in CodeBuild (ARM64), pushed to a per-agent ECR
  repository, and the container URI is provided to the AgentCore Runtime. For local development (`agentcore dev`), the
  container is built and run locally with volume-mounted hot-reload.

### Supported Frameworks (for template agents)

- **Strands** - Works with Bedrock, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini
- **LangChain_LangGraph** - Works with Bedrock, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini
- **GoogleADK** - Gemini only
- **OpenAIAgents** - OpenAI only


### Specific Context

Directory pathing to local projects is required for runtimes. Both CodeZip (Python zip) and Container (Docker image)
deployment options are available.

## Deployment

The `agentcore/cdk/` subdirectory contains an AWS CDK node project.

Deployments of this project are primarily intended to be orchestrated through the `agentcore deploy` command in the CLI.

Alternatively, the project can be deployed directly as a traditional CDK project:

```bash
cd agentcore/cdk
npm install
npx cdk synth   # Preview CloudFormation template
npx cdk deploy  # Deploy to AWS
```

## Editing Schemas

When modifying JSON config files:

1. Read the corresponding `agentcore/.llm-context/*.ts` file for type definitions
2. Check validation constraint comments (`@regex`, `@min`, `@max`)
3. Use exact enum values as string literals
4. Use CloudFormation-safe names (alphanumeric, start with letter)
5. Run `agentcore validate` command to verify changes.
